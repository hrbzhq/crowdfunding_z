Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes harassing comments, personal attacks, trolling, publicly shaming contributors, and other unprofessional conduct.

Enforcement

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.
